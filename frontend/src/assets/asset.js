Set Communication Norms</h2><p>Use async tools like Notion, Slack, and Loom. Set expectations clearly—don’t assume.</p><h2>2. Hire for Autonomy</h2><p>Self-starters thrive remotely. Screen for initiative and clarity in communication.</p><h2>3. Host Virtual Retreats</h2><p>Regular virtual meetups and offsite retreats build camaraderie and trust.</p><h2>4.

Not Validating the Idea</h2><p>Don’t build in the dark. Talk to potential users before writing code or making products.</p><h2>2. Underpricing Services</h2><p>Charge based on value, not insecurity. Your prices set the tone for your brand.</p><h2>3. Doing Everything Solo</h2><p>Hire freelancers, get a mentor, or find a co-founder. You can't scale alone.</p><h2>4. Ignoring Cash Flow</h2><p>Profit is great, but cash flow pays the bills. Monitor income and expenses religiously.</p><h2>5. Scaling Too Soon</h2><p>Master your product-market fit before trying to grow.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Failure isn’t final—but it can be expensive. Learn fast, iterate faster.</p>",
